# Mini SOC Home Lab – Wazuh SIEM

This project demonstrates a **Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab**
built using **Wazuh SIEM** on an **Ubuntu Server virtual machine**.

The goal is to understand how a SIEM works, how logs are collected,
and how security alerts are generated and analyzed.

---

## Lab Environment

- Host OS: Windows 11
- Hypervisor: VirtualBox
- Guest OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Wazuh version: X.Y.Z
- VM Resources:
  - CPU: 2 vCPU
  - RAM: 2 GB
  - Disk: 30 GB
- Network mode: Bridged

This screenshot shows the Ubuntu Server virtual machine configured in VirtualBox
and used as the Wazuh Manager host.

### Wazuh Manager service status

This screenshot confirms that the Wazuh Manager service is active and running
before performing any detection or attack simulation.

## Lab Overview

- **SIEM Platform:** Wazuh
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Environment Type:** Home Lab / Educational

---

## Architecture

- Ubuntu Server VM running Wazuh Manager
- Wazuh services enabled and running
- Logs collected and analyzed locally
- Alerts generated and stored in JSON format
  
---

## Installation Summary

1. Created an Ubuntu Server virtual machine on VirtualBox
2. Installed system updates
3. Installed Wazuh Manager
4. Enabled and started Wazuh services
5. Verified service status using `systemctl`
6. Generated and checked security alerts

---

## Service Status Verification

Wazuh Manager service status was verified using:

```bash
systemctl status wazuh-manager
```

The service is active and running correctly.

---

## Detection Scenario – SSH Brute Force Simulation

To simulate a real SOC detection scenario, multiple failed SSH login attempts were generated from a Windows host using a non-existent user.
Example command used:

```bash
ssh fakeuser@wazuh-server-ip
```

Multiple incorrect passwords were entered to trigger authentication failures.

---

## Alert Analysis

During the SSH brute-force simulation, Wazuh generated a security alert related to multiple failed authentication attempts.

Key fields observed:
- rule.id
- rule.level
- srcip
- user
- frequency

---

### First Triage Actions

As a SOC analyst, my first steps would be:
1. Validate if the source IP is internal or external
2. Check if similar attempts occurred on other hosts
3. Verify the targeted user account
4. Evaluate containment actions (IP blocking or rate limiting)

---

## Detection Result

This screenshot shows the alert generated by Wazuh after the SSH brute-force simulation.

---

## Alert Verification
Security alerts were checked using:

```bash
sudo grep -i "rule" /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.json | tail -n 5
```

This confirms that Wazuh successfully generated and logged security events related to SSH authentication failures.

## What I Learned

1. SIEM architecture and concepts
2. How Wazuh collects and analyzes logs
3. How to verify running security services
4. How to inspect alerts via command line
5. Linux system administration skills
